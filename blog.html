      <h2>My study choice</h2>
      <p>I always had an interest to do something with IT but I never knew what exactly I wanted to do. This is why I first studied a course
        for maritime officer. Over the past years during my studies I visited different schools and courses to see what I find interesting.
        Programming is what I found the most interesting and this course will allow me to orientate between 3 specialties in the first two years.
      </p>
      <p>Like I said before I choose this school I visited various other schools like, gamedevelopment, bachelor for MAROF, engineering and computer science. There was a point I completely lost interest
        and just decided to to continue with my maritime career. But I always wanted to get my bachelor degree and by the time covid was over and I resigned from my company I gave it another try.
        and found this course at the HZ.
      </p>
      <p>So far I don't have any plans what I want do fo after I finished my study my biggest priority is to get expeirence as soon as possible. Hopefully during my course if I am working on a project
        I get in touch with a company I can work for after I graduate.

      <h2>Personal swot-analysis</h2>
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <p>What I lack in programming skills I can make up for with my expierence. If there is problem I try to think of solution and work as a teamplayer.
      </p>
      <h3>Opportunities</h3>
      <p>Having resigned my previous job I now have the opportuny to start a full time study as well as a chance to change profession.
      </p>
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <p>My weakness is I think too much which leads to doubts and nervousness. Due to my lack of expierence I will ask a lot of questions and I want to make sure`
        what is asked of me is clear so I know precisely what do to.
      </p>
      <h3>Threats</h3>
      <p>The catch for me trying to change to a whole different profession means im neglecting the other. which is my maritime career while im studying I wont get any
        experience and I will forget some knowledge too. Worst one being over time I will lose my license that allows me to do my job.

        This is why if that happends I know that I will have to fully commit to this. 
      </p>

      <h2>Programming skills</h2>
      <p>My programming skills before I started were basically zero. I did try some courses with javascript at codeacademy and I tried a bit of python myself. One of the reason I want to do a full time study
        is to fully commit myself and learn as much as I can to get acquainted with all sorts of programming languages out there.

      <h2>Feedback from the Who am I assignment</h2>
      <p>Hi Tim, Nice to have you on onboard! I read you did the maritime officer's education prior to ours. I used to teach at the maritime officer's academy of the HZ
        so we have something in common. Somehow you will never be without that maritime aspect. We do the IT project for unmanned ships So I hope you don't completely dislike anything maritime?
        Also they lack a lot of good IT background people in the maritime industry so you might be doing a very smart study here if you ever want to combine the two. Trying to find the
        intrinsic motivation will be important for a succesful study so try to figure that out in the first quartile. You will get a lecture about it too. As you already have expierenced the
        though maritime work environment you will have no problems with the slower pace of our program. You might even find that some students should stop complaining. As an engineer, you know about
        team spirit so I do not see any problems there either. Programming is quite different from engineering though but at least when the computer shuts down they won't yell at you. Asking a lot of
        questions is what we want you to do and everything else will fall into place. You will have a study career coach appionted to you who can help you with everything your unsure of. The only thing you
        to keep in mind is going back from work freedom to fulltime study takes some times to get used to and cost more energy than you might think. Hope to meeting you soon, Daphne
      </p>
      <h2>My thoughts from the feedback</h2>
      <p>Im quite happy with the feedback I gotten from the assignment I didnt expect there would be people who also had some expierence with the maritime stuff.
        I do agree that getting used to school-life is probably the most challenging part, for me its also my first time studying HBO where there is a completely different mindset than on MBO.
        Motivation is also something that I find very important which was one of the reasons I didnt study for a year since a was a bit sick of school after my last course.
        So this year will be very interesting and im looking forward whats to come.

      <h2>Company safary</h2>
      <p>Since I dont have a direction for myself in mind I just went with some companies that peaked my interest. From my expierence I feel I dont want to work for too large companies like google.
        I feel more comfortable with smaller companies where everyone knows eachother and help eachother. I want to work for a company that shows effort for his employes and communicates with them.
      </p>
      <p>I looked at the companies that took my interest and the vacancies available that are open after I graduate. I didn't went too specically for a job. Since I don't know what I want to do yet after
        I graduate.
      </p>
      <h3>Creative assembly</h3>
      <p>CA is a company that was founded in 1987 it has around 840 employees of all kinds of nationalities. The studio strives to develop good quality games and they value teamwork, respect and trust a lot.
      </p>
      <p>I play quite a few games developed by this company which is why I was interested in looking at CA. in short creative assembly is a game company with a diverse team of people with different nationalities.
        Its a game company that develops game that pushes boundaries and is creative. The positions they offer are flexible and offer a hybrid of functions which speaks to me since I prefer to be flexible.
        The company is located outside of the netherlands in the united kingdom. One of the benefits studying for the international course is that I get the freedom to work for companies outside of the country.
      </p>
      <p>The studio also offers to assist with relocating as well as giving people the ability to work from home. These are on of the many benefits the company is offering to its employees.
        I believe the company is also looking after its employees which I find very important to look for a company.
      </p>
      <h3>Damen shipyard</h3>
      <p>Damen was founded in 1927 and has about 11.000 employees. A large company such as this needs good IT infrastructe which is why I took an interest in this company. While the company does have a large amount
        of employees it is divided in departments and I believe IT is just a small part of this organization.
      </p>
      <p>I went for damen shipyards due to my maritime background and wanted to see what options I have to company the two studies I did. The company is always aiming to improve the contructions of their ships as well
        as improve their working method.
      </p>
      <p>One benefit for me is locations its close by and I wont have to move. Also the company motivating its employees to grow and develop themselves is something that peaks my interest especially their program
        called damen academy.
      </p>
      <h3>Google</h3>
      <p>Google is one of the younger companies but now one of the largest today. it was founded in 2004 and has 85.000 employees. They operate on of the worlds most used web applications and search engines which is their mission
        and responisibity.
      </p>
      <p>Although its sort of contradicting for me to say I dont like to work for big companies but yet I still choose a big company like google. Why I chose this is because working for google can be quite an expierence.
        Having the opportunity to work on software almost everyone uses day to day and see how their company opperates surely would help me grow further in my career.
      </p>
      <p>Google accepts people with entry level and they also promote to develop yourself. Which for me is quite convicing that a company as big as google is looking after its employees.
