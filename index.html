    <h2>the Assignment</h2>
    <p>This site was developed within 2 weeks using html and css. the assignments and specifications which can be found here: <a href= "https://www.notion.so/Assignment-Specification-661c5ac5d7494328a58be61d00dd41e4">Assignment</a>
    the idea of the assignment was for us to be introduced into coding and for the school to see how well we perform with it. Setting up a site in two weeks using
  software you are not familiar with is quite the expierence, but it was good expierence and I learned a lot from it.</p>
    <p>I first started developing on the layout, menus and the general codes for every page. This was my first expierence using html and css
      so I didn't know what kinds of codes needed to be added or what was important. So the first few days was mostly rewritting codes and polishing the other pages.
      After that was all in working order I could later add the content which went a bit faster. If there was some bug or error I knew I could conclude that issue had
      possibly more to do with the content than it had with the overall code since I tested that beforehand.
